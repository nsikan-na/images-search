        <div>What is an investment calculator for?</div>
        <p>
          An investment calculator is a simple way to estimate how your money
          will grow if you keep investing at the rate you're going right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          But remember—an investment calculator doesn't replace professional
          advice! If you need help with your investments, we recommend working
          with an expert who'll help you understand what you're investing in. If
          that's your next step, we can help you <span>connect with a pro</span>{" "}
          near you.

        <p>
          The real question is—what do you really want to do? Do you want to
          travel the world? Spend more time with your family? Get that beach or
          mountain house you always dreamed about? C'mon, don't limit yourself!
